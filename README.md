# Intruder Detection using CNN and Computer Vision

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an Intruder Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Computer Vision techniques. The goal is to accurately identify potential intruders in real-time surveillance footage, contributing to enhanced security measures.

## Features
- Utilizes deep learning and CNN to process video frames and detect potential intruders.
- Real-time analysis of surveillance footage for immediate threat identification.
- High accuracy in differentiating between normal activity and suspicious behavior.
- Easy integration with existing security systems and cameras.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intruder-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd intruder-detection`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Prepare a video feed or use pre-recorded surveillance footage.
2. Run the detection script: `python detect_intruders.py --input_video input.mp4`
3. The system will process the frames, identify intruders, and mark suspicious regions.
4. The processed video will be saved with annotations for review.

## Configuration
- You can adjust detection sensitivity and other parameters in the `config.json` file.
- Fine-tune the model and retrain it on your dataset for specific use cases.

## Results
Provide insights into the performance of your detection system:
- Accuracy achieved on the test dataset.
- Sample frames from the processed video showing correct intruder identification.
- Comparison of different CNN architectures considered and their respective accuracies.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used for training and evaluation:
- Number of classes (intruder and non-intruder).
- Size of the dataset and number of annotated frames.
- Any data augmentation techniques applied.

## Model Architecture
Explain the CNN architecture used for intruder detection:
- 2 Dense layers and 2 convelution layers and 2 pooling layers.


## Future Enhancements
Outline potential improvements and features that can be added:
- Multi-camera support for broader surveillance coverage.
- Integration with alerts and notifications to security personnel.
- Real-time tracking of intruders across frames.
